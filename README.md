This program identifies the longest reducible words from a provided list using hash tables for efficient storage and retrieval. It employs recursive techniques to determine whether a word can be reduced to the basic vowels 'a', 'i', or 'o' by sequentially removing letters, while leveraging double hashing to handle collisions. The program optimally processes the input to return the longest reducible words and tracks the computation time for performance analysis.
